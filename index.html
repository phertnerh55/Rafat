                Education is extremely important to Kibera families, who
                recognize its potential to lift students out of poverty.
                Although both primary and high school have been declared free by
                the Kenyan government, the reality is that there are fees and
                expenses associated with attending school that many families
                can’t afford, forcing students to drop out early or attend
                substandard schools.
              </p>
              <p>
                Scholarship recipients receive payment of school fees, school
                field trips, school uniforms, textbooks, some school supplies,
                termly life skills workshops, and mentorship and guidance from
                the Rafat staff. Recipients are chosen on the basis of need and
                academic performance from the community and from participants in
                our other programs who are doing well in school. Before
                admission into the program, Rafat staff conduct an interview
                with the student and his/her guardians, visit the student’s
                home, and review past academic performance.

                Soccer is very popular among youth in Kibera. Our largest and
                most well-known program in Kibera, the soccer academy makes it
                possible to reach vulnerable children and youth in ways that
                might not have otherwise been possible. We use soccer as a
                vehicle to promote life skills and the importance of education.
                Coaches act as mentors and learn each child’s personality and
                background, enabling Rafat to connect them to other resources.
              </p>

              <p>

                  secondary school of my choice so they could help me achieve my
                  goals . At first ,my dreams were shattered since my parents
                  were not finacialy stable to pay my school fees , In this
                  worst condition ,Rafat gave me a new hope since they were
                  ready to hold my hunds and support through my education and i
                  am now in school studying very smart to achieve my goals in

                  "My name is Gift Barbra My dream has always been to become a
                  nurse. I am a mother of two and received the scholarship
                  through Rafat Foundation.Being a mother and in school at the
                  same time is very hectic. I get overwhelmed sometimes,
                  especially during exams. I have to study and attend to my kids
                  at the same time.It can be draining but i push forward.

                  Life i Kibera is challenging, especially when you become
                  pregnant while still young.Most parents feel like you are a
                  waste or embarrassement to the family and any chance to take
                  you to school dies right there and then.I would encourage all
                  young mothers to embrace any opportunity coming on their way,
                  especially one that involves going back to school.Knowledge is
                  power"
